Our Assignment was to recreate a website from a photo using HTML and CSS without the aid of a libraries. 
The hardest part for me was creating the green stripe label that overlays the photos on the portfolio page. I ended up using relative and absolute positioning to accomplish the effect which looks great on my computer, but probably falls apart on smaller screens and phones.
